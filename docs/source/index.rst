EdgeL3 is an open-source Python library for downloading pruned sparsified L3 models and computing deep audio embeddings from such models for edge 
applications. The audio models provided in EdgeL3 are a result of sparsification and fine-tuning of original Look, Listen and Learn (L3) [3] audio network. For details about pruning and re-training implementation, please see:
