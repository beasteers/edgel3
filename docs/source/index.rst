EdgeL3 is an open-source Python library for downloading sparse L3 models and computing deep audio embeddings from such models for edge 
applications. The sparse audio models provided in EdgeL3 have been re-trained using two different mechanisms as described in:

`EdgeL3: Compressing L3-Net for Mote-Scale Urban Noise Monitoring <https://github.com/ksangeeta2429/Publications/raw/master/EdgeL3_Compressing_L3_Net_for_Mote_Scale.pdf>`_
